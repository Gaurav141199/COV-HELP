Covid Plasma Donation App

The app focuses on providing Plasma donation facility to people who have recovered from COVID 19. 

Main Components on Sign Up:- 

1) Email ID and phone number verfication
2) Blood group Collection

The database has a parent node "Users" in which the user is assigned a UID and this is used to store the information for the patient.

On signing in the app shows you the live no. of cases in various states and the conditions to required for you to be a valid donor. 
The UI is very user friendly which can be seen through the screenshots in the screen shots folder.

A Donate now option is given in this page which takes you to the screen which takes care of the necessary conditions for Plasma donation.

The next page has two options:-

1) to register the user (we contact the user when plasma is needed in that district)
2) Donate at the Plasma Bank now.(Incase your city has a plasma bank, you can schedule an appointment to donate)

On registration you are registered as a donor in that district which is visible to the hospitals where plasma therapy is available through the website designed.

On clicking "Donate plasma bank" you need to choose the available Time and date at the given hospital and you need to upload your first COVID report.

On scheduling an appointment you get an option to view and cancel the appointment before 24 hrs of the booking.

Use of API's, Firebase as Database service, built for both iOS and android and use of authentication, realtime database and storage.
